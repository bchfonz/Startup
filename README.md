# Startup
Ben: I've learned more about merging conlficts which is really helpful. I also didn't I could fork a repository which seems really helpful. I found the DadJokesAPI very interesting haha

Carson: Something I learned was more about github in general. I've never used it before extensively and it looks like in this class we will, and I know that we will need to use it in the future in jobs and what not. Just learning how to navigate the site and how everything works was very interesting. 

Elevator pitch:
You love to play soccer. But finding places and people to play with can be so hard. With my website, you will be able to find and schedule times and places to play pickup soccer. All you have to do is enter in your zip code or city and a calender will pop up and show you where and when pickup games are happening and it will show you how many people are planning on going to play. And if you want to get a group together to play you can creat your own event that others near by will be able to see. Now you will have no problem being able to play the game you love.
