# Startup
Ben: I've learned more about merging conlficts which is really helpful. I also didn't I could fork a repository which seems really helpful. I found the DadJokesAPI very interesting haha

Things I learned from the simon HTML:
Tags like div and header aren't always neccessary but they help keep everything organized
HTML can nest some of the things I've been learning about. For example you can use an svg as a button
br and hr can be used to style the website a little bit


Carson: Something I learned was more about github in general. I've never used it before extensively and it looks like in this class we will, and I know that we will need to use it in the future in jobs and what not. Just learning how to navigate the site and how everything works was very interesting. 

Things I learned from the simon HTML:
More about tables in html. The table in scores.html used <.table>, <.thead>, <.tbody>, <.tr>, <.th>, and <.td>. That's a lot of tags for one element, but I guess I'll have this assignment to reference if I have trouble in the future. Also, I haven't used vscode much in the past, so learning better how to clone, push, and commit with git was good. 

Things I learned from the simon CSS:
I was going through copy+pasting code from the css project into my html one, and css really isn't all that much extra code. It doesn't really add any extra lines besides <.div> stuff, and just lengthens html ones. The biggest difference I saw was in the <.header> stuff. It didn't make a huge difference in result, but it definitely polished up some rough edges and made the website feel more legit. 




Elevator pitch:
You love to play soccer. But finding places and people to play with can be so hard. With my website, you will be able to find and schedule times and places to play pickup soccer. All you have to do is enter in your zip code or city and a calender will pop up and show you where and when pickup games are happening and it will show you how many people are planning on going to play. And if you want to get a group together to play you can creat your own event that others near by will be able to see. Now you will have no problem being able to play the game you love.
